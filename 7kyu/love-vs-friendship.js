// Your task is to write a function which calculates the value of a word based off the sum of the alphabet positions of its characters.

// The input will always be made of only lowercase letters and will never be empty.

// FUNDAMENTALS

function wordsToMarks(string) {
  let total = 0;
  let aOffset = 'a'.charCodeAt(0) - 1;
  // Iterate through each letter
  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
    // Sum up charCodeAt() take away base value of a-1 to work out position of character in alphabet
    total += string.charCodeAt(i) - aOffset;
