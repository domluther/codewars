// Once upon a time, on a way through the old wild mountainous west,…
// … a man was given directions to go from one point to another. The directions were "NORTH", "SOUTH", "WEST", "EAST". Clearly "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are opposite, "WEST" and "EAST" too.

// Going to one direction and coming back the opposite direction right away is a needless effort. Since this is the wild west, with dreadful weather and not much water, it's important to save yourself some energy, otherwise you might die of thirst!

// How I crossed a mountainous desert the smart way.
// The directions given to the man are, for example, the following (depending on the language):

// ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST"].
// or
// { "NORTH", "SOUTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST", "NORTH", "WEST" };
// or
// [North, South, South, East, West, North, West]
// You can immediately see that going "NORTH" and immediately "SOUTH" is not reasonable, better stay to the same place! So the task is to give to the man a simplified version of the plan. A better plan in this case is simply:

// ["WEST"]
// or
// { "WEST" }
// or
// [West]
// Other examples:
// In ["NORTH", "SOUTH", "EAST", "WEST"], the direction "NORTH" + "SOUTH" is going north and coming back right away.

// The path becomes ["EAST", "WEST"], now "EAST" and "WEST" annihilate each other, therefore, the final result is [] (nil in Clojure).

// In ["NORTH", "EAST", "WEST", "SOUTH", "WEST", "WEST"], "NORTH" and "SOUTH" are not directly opposite but they become directly opposite after the reduction of "EAST" and "WEST" so the whole path is reducible to ["WEST", "WEST"].

// My solution
// It's a stack.
// Peek at the top of the stack, does it cancel out what you have? If so pop it and ignore current item.

function dirReduc(arr) {
  // ...
}

const dir1 = ['NORTH', 'SOUTH', 'SOUTH', 'EAST', 'WEST', 'NORTH', 'WEST'];
// ["WEST"]
const dir2 = ['NORTH', 'WEST', 'SOUTH', 'EAST'];
// ['NORTH', 'WEST', 'SOUTH', 'EAST']
const dir3 = ['NORTH', 'SOUTH', 'EAST', 'WEST', 'EAST', 'WEST'];
// []

const ans = dirReduc(dir1);
console.log(ans);
